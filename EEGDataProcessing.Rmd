# Overview

This document discusses the analysis pipeline for the experiment's EEG data. We have written custom Python scripts to preprocess and analyze the data set, according to our defined conditions.

# Downloading data

First, we need to ensure that the data is available locally. Both behavioral and EEG data are available on OSF. You may run the code below to download the data.

```{r}
# Uncomment the lines below to download the data:
